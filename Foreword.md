Hello Everyone! 
I had a great time making these puzzles and It has been an awesome experience getting to put out something that people get to enjoy.
That being said I had very limited free time this year and while I did my best to mitigate problems and fumbles with my chalenges there where a few mistakes I am going to better on next year. 

for example:
  - incorrect zip password and ods file flipping for 4^2x4^2.
  - one letter being off in Da Cube!
  - working on fixing issues in Turing Test way to late.
  - not making more challenges for players to solve leading to a bit of downtime.
  - And lastly not frontloading my harder challenges to give people (and myself) enough time to solve them before the end of the competition.

Thank you for reading these walkthroughs and I hope to see you again next year!
